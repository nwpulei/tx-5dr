# DeepCW models

These are local DeepCW ONNX models used by the TX-5DR CW decoder.

The demo serves obfuscated model payloads from hashed URLs. The current English standard models were fetched from:

Decoded ONNX metadata:

You can override the bundled model path with `TX5DR_DEEPCW_MODEL_PATH`.

## Runtime acceleration

TX-5DR uses `onnxruntime-node` for DeepCW inference. CPU is always available.
macOS Apple Silicon can use CoreML, and Linux x64 can expose CUDA or experimental
WebGPU execution providers when the host GPU stack is already installed.

> **macOS Intel note:** Upstream `onnxruntime-node` stopped shipping
> `darwin/x64` prebuilds after 1.23.x (see
> [microsoft/onnxruntime#27961](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/27961)).
> TX-5DR keeps a current `onnxruntime-node` release and does not downgrade just
> for Intel Macs. On those hosts DeepCW/`onnxruntime-node` is unavailable; native
> module preflight treats the missing `darwin/x64` binding as degradable so the
> rest of the app can still start.

Linux GPU acceleration is intentionally self-managed: TX-5DR packages do not
install NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, cuDNN, or other system GPU libraries. For CUDA,
install the NVIDIA driver and CUDA v12 runtime required by `onnxruntime-node`;
if provider initialization fails, switch the CW decoder runtime back to CPU.
